Sheep Game-
Attempted the advanced tasks below. Managed to get them working. I can't remeber what references I used but I kinda just winged it myself and it seemed to work.

    Increase the sheep movement speed over time to increase the difficulty.
    Make the sheep spawn faster over time to increase the difficulty.

Tower defence-
The Enemy prefab 2 is currently not in use as I was trying to implement enemy 2 in the later levels but couldn't figure how/what to put in the if statement to handle the mix of monster types.

Maze-
The OnEnemyTrigger is not working, couldn't figure out where/how to set the trigger to the enemy.
